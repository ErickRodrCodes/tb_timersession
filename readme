tb_timersession by John Ericson Rodriguez.

1. WHAT IS TB_TIMERSESSION?

tb_timersession is a jQuery plugin that allows you to control idle timeouts of absent users. Tb_timersession allows you to generate as many control timers as you need to trigger actions as the time pass by in seconds. The difference with other plugins is that tb_timersession allow you to control as many events you want, not just one or two! Feel free to generate timers depending on the moment you need it!


2.STARTING UP

tb_timersession is very easy to use and implement. At the same time, tb_timersession offers to the developer great flexibility in order to generate time events in the adequate time.

a. Installation

After you download the most recent copy from GitHub, get the zip file and decompress their contents, then copy the tb_timersession flavor you want (non-compressed version and minified version). The files are inside of the directory /src of the compressed file. Once you are ready, place your tb_timersession file in your script folder in your production page.

b. setup

The simplest way to set up your tb_timersession is to include the javascript file in the <head> of your web page, generate your parameters inside of the <script> tag and initialize the code once the page is loaded, like this:
<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery.tb_timersession.js"></script>
<script>
var mytimers = {
    timers : [
        {
            time:10,
            action:function(){...}
        },
        {
            time:20,
            action:function(){...}
        },
        {
            time:30,
            action:function(){...}
        },
    ],
    keepAliveSessionUrl : "http://mysite/keepsessionurl",
    logoutUrl           : "./index.html",
    humanThreshold      : 5,
    keepSessionAction   : function(){...}
}
</script>

c. Initialization

once you have done the setup of your timer event(s), you must add the following code before of the </script> tag where we wrote the timer events:

$(function(){
    $(document).tb_timersession(mytimers);
});

With this, the timer events will be executed once the idle time matches one of the timers.

Note : DO NOT RUN MORE THAN ONE tb_timersession on your page!!! This plugin is intended to be executed once in your application.
